<h1>Hand Football</h1>
<hr/>
Don't have a football? Just two of you to play football?<br/>
Still wanna play football???<br/>

Here it is. Play football, as you play hand cricket in your school days.<br/>

<hr/>
<b>How to Play?</b><br/>
Similar to the game of stone, paper scissors.<br/>
The players strike numbers using their fingers, and when they are close, say difference being less than 3, they lose possession. Otherwise, they pass it to one of their teammates. On four consecutive passes, i.e from defense to the midfield to the strike and into the goal, the player scores one.<br/>
The game goes on for a time limit, or goal limit or strike limit.<br/>
